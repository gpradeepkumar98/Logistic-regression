Employee Promotion Prediction using Logistic Regression


Predicting whether an employee will get promoted or not is crucial for organizations to make informed HR decisions. In this project, we use logistic regression to build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of employee promotions based on various features.



Results

After training the logistic regression model, we evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
