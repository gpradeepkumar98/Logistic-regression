Advantages of using logistic regression

    Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.
    It not only provides a measure of how appropriate a predictor(coefficient size)is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative).
    Good accuracy for many simple data sets and it performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.
    Logistic regression is less inclined to over-fitting but it can overfit in high dimensional datasets.
    The training time of logistic regression algorithm comes out to be far less than most complex algorithms, such as an Artificial Neural Network.

Disadvantages of using logistic regression

    If the number of observations is lesser than the number of features, Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise, it may lead to overfitting.
    Logistic Regression requires average or no multicollinearity between independent variables.
    It is tough to obtain complex relationships using logistic regression. More powerful and compact algorithms such as Neural Networks can easily outperform this algorithm.
    In Linear Regression independent and dependent variables are related linearly. But Logistic Regression needs that independent variables are linearly related to the log odds (log(p/(1-p)).
